# Cratedigger

A music recommendation app that takes user input, queries the Last.fm API for a matched artist to create a dropdown menu, and takes the user selection to query the Last.fm API to return a list of recommended artists. Each result is passed into the Giphy API to return a Gif of each artist/band in the results page.

This was the second project in Juno College's Web Development Bootcamp, originally built with [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/clembrulee, "Clement Sung") (92% final grade).

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Built using JavaScript, Last.fm API, Giphy API, and SCSS

## Project Overview

This is the first project that I worked on with pair programming and I'm proud of the work that we were able to accomplish with multiple APIs, user input, and responsive design. 

This project was almost entirely created with pair programming and was a collaboration from design to completion.

### What to expect soon:
- improved styling on results page
- additional genres added
